This is our final project for NYU Poly's CS3113 Intro to Game Programming (using XNA)

Title: Save the animals
Please read the Project_Documentation.pdf first to get an idea of how to play the game! The object of this game was to exercise the basic concepts taught in our class, such as pixel collision, 3D object transformations, and artificial intelligence (mainly flocking).
