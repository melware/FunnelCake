# Save the Animals #

This is our final project for an Intro to Game Programming course.

Please read the [documentation](https://github.com/melware/FunnelCake/blob/master/Project_Documentation.pdf) first to get an idea of how to play the game.

The object of this project was to exercise the basic concepts taught in class, such as pixel collision, 3D object transformations, and artificial intelligence (mainly flocking).
